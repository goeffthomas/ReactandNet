# ReactandNet
VERY basic integration of .NET with React in the same VS solution with separate projects

## Steps to run
1. Open Command Prompt and navigate to C:
1. Run the following command: git clone https://github.com/goeffthomas/ReactandNet.git
1. Open the VS Solution (may need to wait for npm packages to install--also needed to close/reopen solution)
1. Ensure both Backend and Frontend project run simultaneously Solution -> Properties -> Multiple Starup Projects, both set to Start
1. Click the Start button (Play button) for the solution
1. May take time to build, but should see "page loaded" in console followed by the response from ValuesController in console and on DOM
